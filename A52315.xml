            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>O Ye children of the Family of the Love of Jeſu Chriſt, if ſo be ye love the Love, then conſider alſo the Loves nature; for the Love is clothed with righteouſneſſe, which alſo rejoyceth not<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 13</note> in the iniquity, for her joy is in the truth.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. After ſuch a faſhion conſider ye the Love, and not after a vain courſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the mind of the fleſh,<note n="b" place="margin">Eſa. 40.</note> for all fleſh waxeth old and changeth; but the

                        <p n="3">3. Hereunto have regard, that your life may be in the preſervation of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and fear not, like the fooles or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. For why ſhould ye periſh with the fools and ignorant? wherefore ſhould ye inherit the curſing<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> with the goats?</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Separate<note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 6 Apoc. 18.</note> from them, and behold Gods right hand; for from thence cometh unto us the life of ſalvation, and the light of the holy underſtanding.</p>

                        <p n="13">13. Therefore, O ye lovers of the truth, ſeek unity, and labour for it, and make a departure out of all heatheniſh being, which is after the courſe of the worlds fooliſhneſſe.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Do away the fore-skin<note n="m" place="margin">Deut. 10 Ier. 4</note> of your uncircumciſed hearts: lay away from you (according to the former converſation) the bewitching of the imagination, which glimmereth unto you before the eyes of your ſpirit, and glittereth before your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, as if it were ſome excellent thing.</p>

                        <p n="16">16. If notwithſtanding ye be<note n="o" place="margin">Iam. 1.</note> unwiſe,<note n="p" place="margin">Apoc. 3.</note> blind, and<note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 5</note> poore of ſpirit, yet grieve not your ſelves for all that; for then ye draw neare to the Kingdome of God.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. If you deſire godly wiſdom, then<note n="r" place="margin">Iam. 1</note> pray and believe, ſhe ſhall be given you, ſo far forth as your prayer<note n="ſ" place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> is ſtedfaſt, and as ye pray to God, in a lowly heart,

                        <p n="18">18. Men may find many which pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for wiſdom, and for the right ſight of his Kingdom; but they will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor<note n="t" place="margin">Joh. 9. Apoc. 3.</note> underſtand, that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, poor, and blind, therefore they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nothing.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. For although that the wiſdom ſtood even at their door, yet ſo well ſeen are they, and ſo rich of ſpirit, through their own wiſdome of the knowledge, that the upright wiſdom of God and the being of his Kingdome, muſt be faine to tarry without.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. Therefore right well ſpeaketh the mouth of the Wiſdom, Bleſſed<note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> are the poor of ſpirit; for the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven belongeth unto them, or the wiſdome of God ariſeth (as light) upon them, and not upon the rich, or upon the great knowers.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. For when we of our ſelves are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come poor, blind, or unwiſe, or do forſake that which is ours, and do come to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and meekneſſe of heart,<note n="x" place="margin">Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>1. Eſa</note> then will God dwell with us, and appeare in ſuch hearts, as alſo the Scripture maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104595:70"/>and then are we alſo poor; but God is become rich in us, by means of our vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or becauſe we are poor in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: It is true.</p>
                        <p n="22">22. Theſe and other like things have I in many places diſtinctly ſet forth in the <hi>Glaſs of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and do here alſo ſet forth the ſame in this <hi>Introduction to the holy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;</hi> if any man regard it, let him conſider the inclination of mine underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                        <p n="23">23. But what ſhall I ſay? I find the man much too ſelf-wiſe<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 1. 1 Cor. 1.</note> in his owne conceit, and too void of underſtanding, in the mind of the love; for commonly when the man heareth of the love, and of the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of wiſdom, he rejoyceth him in the hearing, and it ſeemeth as if it liked him well, likewiſe for a time he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it.</p>
                        <p n="24">24. But in concluſion there is nothing among the greateſt ſort but ſelf-feeking, and very little doe they underſtand the firſt Schoole-rule of the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the ſervice of love, for an entrance into the upright life in Jeſus Chriſt; but do underſtand every thing, which is held forth before them out of Gods wiſdome and love, according to their imagination, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:104595:70"/>according to the mind of their liking. They ſeek thereout their own commodity,<note n="z" place="margin">2 Phil. 2.</note> and not the Lords; they run clean back from the mind of the love, and uſe all ſubtilty to manitain their own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                        <p n="25">25. Whereout I obſerve, that the man (which is thus minded) conceiveth of the wiſdom and of the love utterly amiſſe. For which cauſe I likewiſe fear, leaſt the <hi>Glaſſe of Righteouſneſſe</hi> (how plainly and rightly, evidently and clearly ſoever it is ſet forth) ſhall not of many be diſcerned aright, nor yet be conceived of, according to the truth.</p>
                        <p n="26">26. If therefore they diſcern or conceive not a right of ſuch apparent ſentences (as are ſo clearly and plainly uttered) that even every one (which loveth lowlineſſe and righteouſneſſe) muſt needs approve the ſame, and acknowledge that the man and the world is created thereunto) how ſhould they then be able rightly to underſtand or judge of all the myſteries of the Kingdome of God?</p>
                        <p n="27">27. For which cauſes ſake (to the intent no man might have occaſion to eſtrange him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the truth, unleſſe it might be by his own revolting heart) we have hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104595:71"/>or covertly ſet forth nothing, in the <hi>Glaſſe of Righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="28">28. Notvvithſtanding, if any thing be covered or hidden unto any,<note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 4.</note> it is hidden to the unbelievers, who have no deſire nor love to the truth, nor to the life which is of God, for ſuch are darkned<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, through pleaſure in their ovvn mind, and through the ignorance which is in them,<note n="c" place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> and through the blindneſſe of their hearts, do gather unto themſelves,<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> a treaſure of vvickedneſſe, to an horrible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and ſo through their own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, do turn away and ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, from the love, and from her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                        <p n="29">29. But unto all lovers of equity, which have a deſire and belief towards the love, [to the intent that by her ſervice, they might taſt of<note n="e" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> the uncorrupted milk, the Word of God, that<note n="f" place="margin">Pſa. 40. 1 Pet. 1.</note> liveth for ever] we have out of the inclination of love, ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly and clearly, according to the life painted out, and ſet forth the <hi>Glaſſe of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe</hi> that every one, who with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart hath regard thereunto, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the underſtand of Righteouſneſſe, ſhall be vvell ſatisfied therein.</p>
                        <p n="30">30. If alſo any man turn his heart unto
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104595:71"/>God, and deſire to do his will, the ſame ſhall likewiſe well underſtand, that the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the upright life in the love, (as it is ſet forth in the <hi>Glaſſe of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>) is the upright ground of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that God from the beginning hath required of the man, which alſo in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring thereof ſhall continue for ever, to the Salvation of the vvorld, according to the promiſes, even as God hath ſpoken the ſame aforetimes, by the mouth of his holy Prophets, who have all<note n="g" place="margin">Eſa. 2.60.61.62. Jer. 31. Joel. 2.3. Zach. 2.8. Mich. 4. Soph. 3. Mal. 4.</note> vvitneſſed and prophecied of that ſame upright life, for to come in the laſt time, and in the ſame ſhall alſo all conſciences be appeaſed.</p>
                        <p n="31">31. For the end or fulneſſe of the ſame, is the revealing or coming of the Kingdom of God, and the beholding of the joyes and Salvation of the eternall,<note n="h" place="margin">Eſa. 35.51.60.65. Apo. 21.22.</note> perfect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible being.</p>
                        <p n="32">32. Oh that the man had any underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the godlineſſe, and did perceive vvhereunto God calleth him, and did in like manner prepare his heart after the meaning of the vvritten ſentences, and did let alone judging by the knowledge!</p>
                        <p n="33">33. But no, the man is much too ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by his knowledge, and therefore he is more inclined to judge of every thing after
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104595:72"/>his knowledge, then to prepare his heart to the good, under the obedience of the love.</p>
                        <p n="34">34. Therefore it is very much to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that many among the children of men, do oftentimes judge the ſentences and writings (which have out of the ſervice of love, their miniſtration to the good life) according to their Knowledge. For as ſoon as they read or hear the ſame, they ſuppoſe by and by that thet have rightly apprehended, and well underſtood them, not firſt minding to enter in, to obtain, and to live in that which they bear witneſſe of, whereas yet the ſervice of our writing ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth hereunto, even that mens hearts (as is there ſet forth) ſhould be prepared to the ſame.</p>
                        <p n="35">35. For men ſtrike up no alarm, in the hoſt, to the intent to make the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſty to the battell, nor yet that they ſhould but know the exerciſe of the warr, or judge of the Alarm-ſtroak, but that (with good courage) they ſhould prepare themſelves to the battell or fight. Thereby every one (that hath courage to fight) doth then make himſelf ready to incounter with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to root out his adverſary, or to ſubdue him.</p>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:104595:72"/>
                        <p n="36">36. But (alas) I find it with many, otherwiſe in that alarm by which the man is called to the ſpirituall<note n="i" place="margin">Eph. 6.</note> fight, to the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing of his enemies, which (inwardly in him) are killers and murderers of his ſoul.</p>
                        <p n="37">37. Therefore it is very true, that the children of this world are much<note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> wiſer in their dealing, as concerning the fleſh, then the children of the Kingdom are, in that which concerneth the ſpirit.</p>
                        <p n="38">38. What availeth I pray you, an alarm made, if men prepare them not to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell? for many are perſwaded, that this is no time of fighting, and that there ſhall be no need thereof; ſuppoſing, becauſe of their unbelief, that nothing ſhall come of it; and lay their hands behind on the back, or put them up in the boſome. Their heads are giddy, as if their hearts were utterly unluſty, or diſmaid to the fight.</p>
                        <p n="39">39. If one ſhould ſeek for men of warre, where I pray you, ſhould he find them? Are they not for the moſt part gone back,<note n="l" place="margin">Levit. 26. Jer. 48.</note> and become faint hearted as women?</p>
                        <p n="40">40. If they do but once ſuffer harm, and be wounded; or forced by any evill defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104595:73"/>or aſſault of the wicked) to ſuſtain any moleſtation or reproach, then are they perſvvaded, that the cauſe is altogether nought, and ſo running again after their caſe, they ſuffer themſelves to be ruled by women,<note n="m" place="margin">Eſa. 3.</note> their enemy to raign over them; and in like manner make truth<note n="n" place="margin">Eſa. 28.</note> with death, and a league with hell, retain peace with the ſin and accuſer, and become of one mind with the world, ſuppoſing that then all ſhall be well: moreover they make an appointment or concluſion with themſelves, that they will no more trouble themſelves with the doctrine of the Family of Love, nor yet vvith the battell, thinking, <hi>Let them run that will.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="41">41. For to reſiſt the evill, to break and ſubdue the wicked heart and evil thoughts, and to ſuffer much diſtreſſe, contempt, and reproach, for the ſame liketh them not; they will none of that Howbeit, we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to fight againſt the evill, and to keep good watch continually: we are alwaies to think night and day upon the vertue of the godly life, alwaies to long, and to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt after it, alvvaies to ſpeak and to treat thereof, with ſuch as do ſo labour thereafter; and yet then of many ſorts of people (and letter-learned) to be deſpiſed and reproached.</p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:104595:73"/>
                        <p n="42">42. Becauſe of this toil, and for the ſhame and reproaches cauſe, which meeteth them (and becauſe they love not the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the godly life, with the heart) they let the matter paſſe, ſaying, out of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, <hi>I cannot further it, I hold me ſtill or unoccupied about it: let the Lord work it, I will commit it unto him.</hi> Suppoſing when they thus paſſe on according to their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, or do live after the faſhion of the world, and (with an<note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> unrepenting heart towards God, do hold peace with the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers and ſtrivers, againſt the truth of Chriſt and his love, that then God will make it to be well with them.</p>
                        <p n="43">43. Deceive not your ſelves ye dearly beloved, the ſaying is very right,<note n="p" place="margin">Act. 16. Eph. 3.

                        <p n="63">63. Now although I have here ſhewed, that my reſpect was leſſe upon the outward obedience, then upon the inward godly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and that I thus laboured for ſuch an upright heart and mind, as was required by the outward obedience, becauſe I would<note n="l" place="margin">Deut. 6.10.</note> ſerve the living God in his upright righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, yet did I not therefore deſpiſe the outward obedience, nor the good Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their right uſe, neither is it my mind or will, that men ſhould not obſerve nor obey the right uſe of the Churches ſervices, or the Prieſts or Elders Ordinances, which
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:104595:88"/>are exerciſed for a good outward diſcipline and decency, and to a bringing in of the ſaid upright righteouſneſſe!

                        <p n="64">64. For ſo in that behalf, men are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to eſteem the outward Ordinances, and the obedience to the ſame, yet with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the underſtanding, as according to their worth, and in reſpect of them for whom they are neceſſary, namely, in ſuch conſideration, as the Ordinances and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Law of the Lord<note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 10.

                        <p n="65">65. Wherefore men ought even before all things, to give the worthieſt praiſe and greateſt honour to the greateſt or beſt, and not to reſpect or eſteem the ſmalleſt, for the principalleſt: Likewiſe to obſerve a difference, between the prudent, good-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ſtable ones, and thoſe that are without underſtanding, evill willers, and revolters, that they miniſter not the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Ordinances confuſedly or mixtly out of the knowledge, nor diſorderly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the obeying of the ſame, as if any man

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:104595:129"/>nor yet diſcerned or knew the ſame from the commandement according to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, therefore were they<note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 3.5</note> lead away with the outward, from proceeding in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and were very miſerably bewitched with the outward, becauſe they thought that even the ſalvation of ſouls lay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
                        <p n="29">29. On the other ſide, there were alſo many among the Corinthians, that<note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 3</note> made conſcience, and counted it for an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to buy, eat, or uſe the offering of the Idols, after the manner of the heathens ceremonies, ſuppoſing that Gods forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and the hurt of ſouls, lay in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ceremonies of the heathen, and that of themſelves alone they were Idol-ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

                        <p n="30">30.
